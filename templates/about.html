<h1>Sheldon Jones</h1> 
<p>Sometimes I wonder if I am making the right life choices. Especially  <br> those decisions that have grave impact on
    where they will lead me. </br>
    How do I know the still voice of the Devine versus those of my own<br>
    telling me what to do and not to do. Like, I know I enjoy aspects of </br>
    computing which are more practical than theoretical; more like a technician. <br>
    Yet the more qualified persons tend to do the supervision of the </br>
technician which to me takes the fun out of the practicality that I enjoy. </p>
